## 1.Some interesting algorithm solutions

   **1! 5! :**	 (I got nothing to smoke, 小马都无力去测)

## 2.All implement about data structure Both C and CPP

**1.Table :** list, stack, queue

**2.Tree :** binary, avl, splay, Btree

**3.Hash :** solutions of hash conflicts

    (by the way, hash is easy for mathematical learner, so that we just implement with c language)

**4.Heap :**  binary heap(priority queue), d heap, leftist heap, skew heap ...

##### -- TODO --

## 3. Practice: best work of algorithm && datastructure

**1. Practice:**  ***Hash Map by cpp*** : (what a fucking hard work)

- This will try to implement hash map like Java;
- basic function: put, get, remove, getSize, isEmpty;
- details:

- [X] Red-Black tree and list(bucket) implement to store data;
- [X] auto treeify or untreeify the bucket based on different volumn of data;
- [X] auto expand capacity when size scale more than load factor(0.75);
- [X] make it safe for multiple thread;
