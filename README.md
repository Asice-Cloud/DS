## All implement about data structure Both C and CPP

**1.Table :** list, stack, queue

**2.Tree :** binary, avl, splay, Btree

##### -- DOING --

**3.Hash :** solutions of hash conflicts,

    (by the way, hash is easy for mathematical expert)

> **3.5. Practice:**  ***Hash Map by cpp*** :
>
> - This will try to implement hash map like Java;
> - basic function: put, get, remove, getSize, isEmpty;
> - details:
>
> - [X] Red-Black tree and list(bucket) implement to store data;
> - [X] auto treeify or untreeify the bucket based on different volumn of data;
> - [X] auto expand capacity when size scale more than load factor(0.75);
> - [X] make it safe for multiple thread;
